- Our code repository [GiDR-DUN](https://github.com/Andrew-Draganov/GiDR-DUN) includes:
    - a simplified implementations of UMAP that runs significantly faster than the default implementation
    - a simplified implementation of tSNE that runs at UMAP speeds
    - an implementation of GDR -- our method that can reproduce both tSNE and UMAP outputs
