I am an ML researcher studying how models represent information in high dimensional spaces. To this end, I have studied:
- Neural Network Interpretability
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Clustering

I am also broadly interested in all aspects of AI security/safety and am working more and more on these topics.

### Other Things

- I am originally from Washington DC which, despite what my European friends may expect, is the loveliest city in the world.
- I am trying to contribute to effective AI communication.
- My email is draganovandrew (at) cs.au.dk -- feel free to reach out about anything
