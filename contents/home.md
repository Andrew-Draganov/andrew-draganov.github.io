### About me

I am a PhD student in machine learning at Aarhus University under the supervision of Chris Schwiegelshohn (along with help from Davide Mottin, Ira Assent and
Cigdem Aslay).
My research revolves around understanding how information is represented in high-dimensional spaces. To this end, I study:
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Deep Learning (specifically contrastive and self-supervised learning)

Generally speaking, I like to make theoretical insights practical and make practical algorithms have theoretical substance.

### Other Things

- I am originally from Washington DC which, despite what my European friends may expect, is the loveliest city in the world.
- I really enjoy teaching and for making technical concepts approachable.
- My **email** is draganovandrew (at) cs.au.dk -- feel free to reach out about anything
