### About me

I am a PhD student in machine learning at Aarhus University under the supervision of Chris Schwiegelshohn (along with help from Davide Mottin and Ira Assent).
My interests are in understanding how information is represented in high-dimensional spaces. To this end, I study:
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Deep Learning (specifically contrastive and self-supervised learning)

Generally speaking, I like to make theoretical insights practical and make practical algorithms have theoretical substance.

### Other Things

- I am originally from Washington DC which, despite what my European friends may expect, is the loveliest city in the world.
- I have a passion for teaching and for making technical concepts approachable.
- If you'd like to reach out, my email is draganovandrew (at) cs.au.dk . Warning -- I am a big believer in smiley faces in emails.
