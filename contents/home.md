I am an ML researcher studying how models represent information. I am also broadly interested in all aspects of AI security/safety and try to have reasonably informed opinions on this topic.

My technical research is about how information is represented in high-dimensional spaces. I am particularly interested in how AI models store and process information. To this end, I have studied:
- Neural Network Interpretability
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Clustering

### Other Things

- I am originally from Washington DC which, despite what my European friends may expect, is the loveliest city in the world.
- I am trying to contribute to effective AI communication.
