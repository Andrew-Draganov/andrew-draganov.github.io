I am a postdoc in data analysis and machine learning at Aarhus University under Chris Schwiegelshohn. I completed my PhD at Aarhus University in Fall 2024, supervised by Cigdem Aslay and Chris Schwiegelshohn (with help from Ira Assent and Davide Mottin).

My research revolves around understanding how information is represented in high-dimensional spaces. I am particularly interested in applying this to understand how AI models store and process information. To this end, I study:
- Neural Network Interpretability
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Clustering

Generally speaking, I like to make theoretical insights practical and make practical algorithms have theoretical substance.

### Other Things

- I am originally from Washington DC which, despite what my European friends may expect, is the loveliest city in the world.
- I really enjoy teaching and making technical concepts approachable.
- My email is draganovandrew (at) cs.au.dk -- feel free to reach out about anything
