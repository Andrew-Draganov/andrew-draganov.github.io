I am a PhD student in machine learning. My research is aimed at understanding what it means to represent information as points in high-dimensional space. To this end, I study:
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Deep Learning (specifically contrastive and self-supervised learning)

I like to make theoretical insights practical and make practical algorithms have theoretical substance.

Currently under the supervision of Chris Schwiegelshohn, along with help from Davide Mottin and Ira Assent.
