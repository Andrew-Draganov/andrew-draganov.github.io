### About me

I am a PhD student in machine learning interested in understanding what it means to represent information as points in high-dimensional space. To this end, I study:
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Deep Learning (specifically contrastive and self-supervised learning)

Generally speaking, I like to make theoretical insights practical and make practical algorithms have theoretical substance.

### Other Things

Currently under the supervision of Chris Schwiegelshohn, along with help from Davide Mottin and Ira Assent.

Separately, I have a passion for teaching and for making technical concepts approachable.
